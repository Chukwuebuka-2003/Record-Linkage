# Record Linkage in Data Science with Python

Record linkage, also known as data matching or entity resolution, is the process of identifying and linking records in one or more datasets that refer to the same entity across different data sources. This is a common task in data science and has various applications such as merging databases, deduplicating records, and integrating data from multiple sources.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find an example implementation of record linkage using Python. The example demonstrates how to link English Premier League (EPL) fixtures from two different datasets using the `recordlinkage` library.

## Implementation

### 1. Data Preparation

I started by generating two hypothetical datasets representing EPL fixtures for a season. Each dataset contains columns for the home team, away team, date, and venue of the matches.

### 2. Blocking

I blocked the datasets based on the date of the fixtures to reduce the number of comparisons.

### 3. Comparison

I compared fixtures based on the home team, away team, and venue using string similarity measures such as Levenshtein distance.

### 4. Classification

I then set a threshold for similarity scores and classify potential matches based on this threshold.

### 5. Output

The output includes a DataFrame containing the matched pairs along with their similarity scores. In the two example dataframes that i used, the output returned an empty dataframe

## Usage

To run the example implementation:

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install pandas recordlinkage`.
2. Copy the provided Python code into a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Adjust the parameters and threshold as needed.
4. Run the script or notebook to see the output.

## Conclusion

Record linkage is a powerful technique for integrating and deduplicating data from multiple sources. By following the example provided in this repository, you can learn how to implement record linkage in Python for your own datasets.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements!
